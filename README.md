[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/7d5b06f64d1545059ea8399102de6783)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/BuildForSDG/team-239-product?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=BuildForSDG/team-239-product&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Settings)

## About
This is a platform where food producers (farmers) can showcase their farm products to secure a market. Investors such as organizations or individuals interested in investing in agriculture can sign contracts with one or more of the registered associations/farmers on the platform to farm a particular product.


## Why

This application is going to greatly reduce the problem of hunger and poverty for especially the rural areas.

## Usage
 How would someone use what you have built, include URLs to the deployed app, service e.t.c when you have it setup


## Setup

Install `npm` or `yarn` if you dont have any of them already installed. We recommend Yarn though.

After clonning the repo to your local machine and moving into the cloned folder, Run `yarn install` to get started by installing dependencies. 

`src/index.js` is the entry to the project and source code should go into the `src` folder.

All tests should be written in the `__tests__' folder. There's a sample in there.

#### Hints

- Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to get started. We'll assume you are using Yarn.
- Install additional dependencies: `yarn add <dependency-name> [-D]`
- Run tests: `yarn test`
- Run tests with test coverage info: `yarn test:cover`
- Check the codebase for proper syntax and formatting compliance: `yarn lint`
- Run your app in local dev mode: `yarn dev`.

## Contributing
If this project sounds interesting to you and you'd like to contribute, thank you!
First, you can send a mail to buildforsdg@andela.com to indicate your interest, why you'd like to support and what forms of support you can bring to the table, but here are areas we think we'd need the most help in this project :
1.  area one (e.g this app is about human trafficking and you need feedback on your roadmap and feature list from the private sector / NGOs)
2.  area two (e.g you want people to opt-in and try using your staging app at staging.project-name.com and report any bugs via a form)
3.  area three (e.g here is the zoom link to our end-of sprint webinar, join and provide feedback as a stakeholder if you can)
